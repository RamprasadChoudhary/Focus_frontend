# Focus_frontend
Focus is an e-commerce website that categorizes its products using category
filters and enables price-based sorting. This website utilizes animation and
achieves filtering and sorting functionalities through a combination of React.js 
and JavaScript. The styling aspect is handled using styled-components.
"Upon opening the homepage, we encounter an animation created with React.js.
Upon clicking the 'Products' button, we arrive at a page displaying the available
products on our website. Here, we can filter the products using the navigation bar's 
filtering feature and sort them based on their prices. These pages were developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
